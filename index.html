                Rangda is Barong's opposite. While Barong represents good,
                Rangda represents evil. Rangda is known as a demon queen, the
                incarnation of Calon Arang, the legendary witch that wreaked
                havoc in ancient Java during the reign of Airlangga in the 10th
                century. It is said that Calon Arang was a widow who had
                mastered the art of black magic, who often damaged farmer's
                crops and caused disease to come. She had a girl, named Ratna
                Manggali, who, though beautiful, could not get a husband because
                people were afraid of her mother. Because of the difficulties
                faced by her daughter, Calon Arang was angry and she intended to
                take revenge by kidnapping a young girl. She brought the girl to
                a temple to be sacrificed to the goddess Durga. The next day, a
                great flood engulfed the village and many people died. Disease
                also appeared.
              </p>
              <p>
                King Airlangga, who had heard of this matter, then asked his
                advisor, Empu Bharada, to deal with this problem. Empu Bharada
                then sent his disciple, Empu Bahula, to be married to Ratna.
                Both were married with a huge feast that lasted seven days and
                seven nights, and the situation returned to normal. Calon Arang
                had a book that contained magic incantations. One day, this book
                was found by Empu Bahula, who turned it over to Empu Bharada. As
                soon as Calon Arang knew that the book had been stolen, she
                became angry and decided to fight Empu Bharada. Without the help
                of Durga, Calon Arang was defeated. Since she was defeated, the
                village was safe from the threat of Calon Arang's black magic.

              <p>
                Other interpretations claim that Rangda was actually derived
                from the historical 11th-century queen Mahendradatta or
                Gunapriyadharmapatni, a Javanese princess sister of Dharmawangsa
                of East Javanese Isyana Dynasty of late Medang Kingdom period.
                She was the queen consort of Balinese king Udayana and
                Airlangga's own mother. Mahendradatta is known for her devotion
                to the cult of Durga in Bali.
              </p>
              <p>
                The story goes that Mahendradatta, the mother of Airlangga, was
                condemned and exiled by the king, Udayana, for allegedly
                practising witchcraft and black magic. After she became a widow,
                hurt and humiliated, she sought revenge upon her ex-husband's
                court and the whole of his kingdom. She summoned all the evil
                spirits in the jungle, the Leyaks and the demons that caused
                plague and death in the kingdom. She proceeded to take her
                revenge by killing off half the kingdom, which by then belonged
                to her and Dharmodayana's son Airlangga, with plague before
                being overcome by a holy man.

              <p>
                In the village of Girah in the Kediri Kingdom long ago, in what
                is now Indonesia, lived a very cruel widow named Calon Arang, a
                witch and a black magician. She had a beautiful daughter named
                Ratna Manggali. But because of her ruthless nature, the people
                of Girah are afraid of Calon Arang, and so, Ratna Manggali had
                no suitors. Knowing this, Calon Arang became furious, holding
                all of the people in the village responsible. She decided to
                place a curse on Girah, she performed a dark ceremony in the
                cemetery by offering the sacrifice of a young girl to Goddess
                Durga. Durga came down and granted the request of Calon Arang
                and the curse came true. A flood engulfed the village and took
                many people’s life. Afterward, many of the survivors became very
                sick with an incurable plague and died.
              </p>
              <p>
                Word of this finally reached to Airlangga, the King of Kediri,
                at the Royal Palace. After learning about the evil actions of
                Calon Arang, King Airlangga sent his army to Girah to kill her,
                but she was so powerful that the army had to retreat, many of
                the king's soldiers were also killed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many days after pondering the situation, King Airlangga asked
                his advisor, Mpu Bharadah, for help. Mpu Bharadah sent his
                disciple, Mpu Bahula, to propose to Ratna Manggali. The marriage
                proposal was accepted, Mpu Bahula and Ratna Manggali hosted a
                marriage ceremony that lasted for seven days and seven nights.
                The celebration pleased Calon Arang very much as Ratna Manggali
                and Mpu Bahula also loved each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not long after, Ratna Manggali told Bahula that Calon Arang kept
                a magic scroll somewhere in her room and performed ceremonies in
                the cemetery every night. So, at midnight, Bahula went to the
                place where Calon Arang lived. That night, Calon Arang slept
                very deeply due to seven days and seven nights of partying in
                her daughter's wedding. Bahula succeeded in stealing Calon
                Arang's magic scroll, returned it to Mpu Bharadah, and told him
                all about Calon Arang's magic and ceremonies. Mpu Bharada told
                Bahula to go back to Girah before he was caught by his
                mother-in-law.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bahula invited his master, Mpu Bharadah, to visit him in Girah.
                Mpu Bharadah and Calon Arang met in the Girah village cemetery.
                Bharada asked Calon Arang to stop practicing her evil magic
                because it caused so much misery among the people. But Calon
                Arang refused to listen to Mpu Bharadah, and eventually, she
                fought a fierce battle with the Kediri soldiers. Because Calon
                Arang didn't have the magic scroll, she could not beat Mpu
                Bharadah. So, she loses the battle and died.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Ratna Manggali found out that her mother had died, she
                wept. Because despite Calon Arang's evil, she had always been
                good to her daughter. However, Ratna Manggali realized that her
                mother's death was for the best. Since then, the village of
                Girah has been happy and safe and secure.

                A white monkey was seen inside the palace of Alengka, moving
                adroitly on the roof and on the trees and sometimes just sitting
                in park. He began to bother some courtiers, ransacking
                something: the palace was in alarm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Several guards who tried to catch him, had been, attacked and
                ran away. The news of the infiltration was heard by Rahwana or
                Dasamuka, the king of Alengkadiraja. He was feeling insulted.
                How could a strong kingdom of Alengkadiraja, ‘respected’ or more
                precisely ‘feared" by other countries, giants and warriors,
                could be put in an uproar by a monkey?
              </p>
              <p>
                His son Indrajit or Megananda, upon Dasamuka’s instruction led
                his troop to catch the monkey. Indrajit’s arrow heirloom –
                Nagapasa was shot. Once the arrow left its bow, it became
                thousands of snakes, wound around its target.
              </p>
              <p>
                The capture of the white monkey was shaking, it was known that
                the white monkey was Anoman – the Senapati – warrior of king
                Ramawijaya. There was no excuse for Anoman, by burning him
                alive. But it was not Anoman if is not Sakti (having strong
                magical power).
              </p>
              <p>
                With his body’s hairs burnt in flame, he could escape. He spread
                the burning flame everywhere, in an instant the palace was
                caught in fire, even many parts of the town. He tried to make
                Rahwana understood, release Dewi Sinta, Rama’s wife peacefully.
                Otherwise a catastrophe should hit Alengka. The stubborn Rahwana
                chose to fight. Anoman reported back to Rama. This episode in
                Wayang Performance is called Amonan Obong (The burning Anoman)

                Traditional Balinese dances are the oldest form of performing
                arts in Bali. Traditional dances can be divided into two types,
                the sacred dances called Wali and entertainment dances called
                Bebalihan. Wali (sacred dances) are usually performed only
                during certain ritual ceremonies. Balinese Hindus believed that
                the sacred dances has strong religious significance and
                spiritual power, thus only can be performed during specific
                religious ceremony by specific dancers. Bebalihan are usually
                performed in social events. In addition to entertain, Bebalihan
                also has other purposes including welcoming guests, celebration
                of harvests, or gathering crowds. Bebalihan has more variations
                than Wali. Pendet is considered as a form of Bebalihan, often
                performed secularly to welcome guests or audiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pendet believed as a representation of Balinese floral offering
                ritual, which offered banten or canang (floral offerings) from
                shrine to shrine within Balinese temple or residential
                compounds. Initially, Pendet dance is used as a complement of
                piodalan ceremonies in temples or family shrines, as a symbol of
                gratitude, respect, and joy when welcoming the presence of the
                gods who descend from khayangan (realm of gods). By the 1950s,
                the dance choreography, movements, costumes and properties were
                codified by two artists from Sumertha village, Denpasar; I Wayan
                Rindi and Ni Ketut Reneng. Both of them created Pendet as a
                welcome dance with four dancers, performed as part of a tourism
                show at a number of hotels in Denpasar, Bali. In 1961, I Wayan
                Beratha developed this dance and increased the number of dancers
                to five, as is often performed now.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1962, I Wayan Beratha and his colleagues developed Pendet
                dance as a mass dance. The number of dancers was no less than
                800 people, and featured in the opening ceremony of the Asian
                Games in Jakarta.

                Kecak was originally a trance ritual accompanied by a male
                chorus. In the 1930s, Walter Spies, a German painter and
                musician, became deeply interested in the ritual while living in
                Bali. He adapted it as a drama based on the Hindu Ramayana and
                including dance, intended for performance before Western tourist
                audiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Walter Spies worked with Indonesian dancer Wayan Limbak, who
                popularized the dance by arranging internationally touring
                performances by Balinese groups. These tours helped make the
                kecak internationally known.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is an example of what James Clifford describes as part of
                the "modern art-culture system" in which "the West or the
                central power adopts, transforms, and consumes non-Western or
                peripheral cultural elements, while making 'art,' which was once
                embedded in the culture as a whole, into a separate entity". I
                Wayan Dibia, a performer, choreographer and scholar, suggests,
                by contrast, that the Balinese were already developing this form
                when Spies arrived on the island. For example, during the 1920s,
                Limbak had incorporated baris movements into the cak leader
                role. "Spies liked this innovation," and he suggested that
                Limbak "devise a spectacle based on the Ramayana," accompanied
                by cak chorus rather than gamelan, as would have been usual.
              </p>

                The kecak dance is typically performed by about fifty to one
                hundred men wearing only loincloths; their upper bodies are left
                bare. They form concentric circles, in the middle of which is a
                traditional Balinese coconut oil lamp. First they move their
                bodies rhythmically to the left and to the right, chanting the
                words "chak ke-chak ke-chak ke-chak" continuously, in slow
                rhythm. Gradually the rhythm speeds up and by turns they lift
                their hands, trembling, into the air. The kecak dance is
                performed for dance-dramas and the story presented is taken from
                the Ramayana Hindu epic. The bare-chested male kecak chanters
                play the role of Rama's troops of Vanaras (apes) and Ravana's
                troops of Rakshasas (giants).
              </p>
              <p>
                The duration of the performance is around an hour. The story of
                the Ramayana is depicted, beginning with Sita and Rama's exile
                in the jungle of Dandaka. The performance reenacts the
                appearance of the Golden Deer, the abduction of Sita by Ravana,
                the battle between Ravana and Jatayu, the search for Sita by
                Hanuman, and ends with the battle between Rama and Ravana. The
                kecak chanters chant and sing in accordance with the mood and
                milieu of the story.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kecak dance performances in Bali usually take place daily in the
                evening (6 pm, Bali time) at Balinese Hindu temples such as
                Uluwatu Temple and Tanah Lot. There are also dance stages used
                exclusively for kecak performances in Ubud, Garuda Wisnu
                Kencana, Batu Bulan, Pandawa beach and other places in Bali.
                Kecak performances also take place on other occasions, such as
                for cultural and entertainment displays. Dancers usually come
                from local villagers of the surrounding area of the performance;
                they usually have a main job other than dancing which they
                finish before performing the kecak dance. The dancers' income
                from the dance usually comes from tickets sold to the
                spectators. The most popular destination for kechak dance
                performances is Uluwatu Temple.

                iNgaben, also known as Pitra Yadyna, Pelebon or cremation
                ceremony, is the Hindu funeral ritual of Bali, Indonesia. A
                Ngaben is performed to release the soul of a dead person so that
                it can enter the upper realm where it can wait for it to be
                reborn or become liberated from the cycles of rebirths. The
                Balinese Hindu theology holds that there is a competition
                between evil residents of the lower realm to capture this soul,
                and a proper cremation enhances the chance that it may reach the
                upper realm
              </p>
              <p>
                A quick Ngaben is preferred, but usually too expensive. In
                Balinese culture, people go through an interim state where they
                bury the dead for a while usually near Pura Prajapati, pool
                funds and cremate many recently dead on the same day in an
                elaborate community-based Ngaben ceremony. Once the families are
                financially ready, they select an auspicious day, make bade
                (coffins) to carry the deads, and announce the event in the
                village. The families also make a patulangan to cremate the body
                in, which is either a lembu (bull or mythical animal-shaped
                bamboo-wood-paper coffin) to burn with the dead, or a wooden
                wadah (temple-like structure). Once the corpse is ready for the
                cremation ground, it is washed, dressed in Balinese attire,
                family and friends pay their last goodbye with prayers and the
                mourners take it for cremation. They carry the corpses with
                rites, dressed in traditional attire, accompanied with gamelan
                music and singing, to the kuburan (cremation grounds). If the
                path passes through major road crossings, the coffin is rotated
                three times to confuse the evil residents of the lower realm.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the cremation ground, the corpse is placed into the
                bull-shaped lembu or temple-shaped wadah, final hymns are
                recited and the cremation pyre lit. While the corpse burns, the
                Balinese music team plays the beleganjur music, a battle song
                symbolizing the soul's fight with evil underworld to reach the
                worry-free upper realm. Twelve days after the cremation, the
                families collect the ashes, fill it inside coconut shell, carry
                it to nearby ocean or sea to return the remains back to the
                elements
